### Deployed via Netlify

https://mghmenu.netlify.app/

## About This Project

This project allows the user to view/submit weekly menus.

## Purpose

The RN's/staff likes to write down their menus for both facilities. This led to inconsistencies where one location may have a completely new menu and/or an altered one. To alleviate grocery issues, this site was made to provide a single source that anyone may easily access. On top of viewing menus, users can create and submit their own menus. All submissions are automatically emailed for review.
